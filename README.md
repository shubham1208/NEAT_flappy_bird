# NEAT_flappy_bird
This is a flappy bird game played by an AI using neat-python. 

It spawns 100 birds and trains to create a perfect bird by genetic learning.

# NEAT-PYTHON
NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) is an evolutionary algorithm that creates artificial neural networks. In this program neat tries to figure out the best topology of neural networks to move the bird futher while avoiding hitting the pipes, the top of screen or and the floor. 

# Instructions
1. Run ```Flappy bird.py```
2. Let the A.I. train for a few runs.
3. When the perfect bird is created it will never die so you have to close the program yourself.
